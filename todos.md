# Vaultx API - Development Tasks

## Core Features
- [x] Set up Express server with TypeScript
- [x] Implement in-memory storage for clips
- [x] Create POST /api/clip endpoint to save clips
- [x] Create GET /api/clip/:token endpoint to retrieve clips
- [x] Add auto-deletion mechanism with configurable expiration
- [x] Generate secure random tokens

## Production Features
- [x] Add rate limiting
- [x] Add request validation
- [x] Add security headers with Helmet
- [x] Add CORS configuration
- [x] Add compression middleware
- [x] Add logging with Morgan
- [x] Add error handling middleware
- [x] Add health check endpoint
- [x] Add environment configuration

## Optional Enhancements
- [x] Password protection for clips
- [x] Burn after reading feature
- [x] Custom expiration times
- [x] Content type support (text, urls, code)
- [x] View count tracking
- [x] Statistics endpoint
- [x] Clip info endpoint
- [x] Manual deletion endpoint

## Testing
- [x] Test server startup ✅
- [x] Test all API endpoints ✅
  - [x] POST /api/clip (create clip)
  - [x] GET /api/clip/:token (retrieve clip)
  - [x] GET /api/clip/:token/info (get metadata)
  - [x] DELETE /api/clip/:token (delete clip)
  - [x] GET /api/stats (statistics)
  - [x] GET /health (health check)
- [x] Test password protection ✅
- [x] Test access counting ✅
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Test burn after reading feature

## Status: **HYBRID STORAGE COMPLETE** ✅

## Completed Hybrid Implementation:
- [x] Core API fully functional
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Implement Redis + In-Memory hybrid storage
- [x] Update package dependencies (ioredis)
- [x] Add Redis connection with graceful fallback
- [x] Update documentation with Redis setup
- [x] Test hybrid storage functionality

## Hybrid Features Implemented:
- [x] Memory-first architecture for speed
- [x] Redis backup layer for persistence
- [x] Automatic failover (works without Redis)
- [x] Intelligent data restoration (Redis → Memory)
- [x] Enhanced statistics (shows both storage layers)
- [x] Graceful Redis connection handling
- [x] Environment variable configuration
- [x] Comprehensive documentation

## Benefits Achieved:
- ⚡ Lightning fast (memory-first)
- 🔄 Persistent (Redis backup)
- 🛡️ Reliable (works without Redis)
- 📊 Observable (detailed stats)
- 🚀 Production ready
